The issue you're encountering stems from the pip install command failing to authenticate against the Nexus repository. The build script is attempting to use the Nexus credentials to install Python dependencies, but the error message indicates that pip cannot retrieve the necessary packages due to an EOFError when reading credentials.

Here’s what you can do to resolve the issue:

### 1. Ensure Correct Environment Variables for Nexus Credentials
Check that the Nexus credentials (`NEXUS_USERNAME` and `NEXUS_PASSWORD`) are correctly set and accessible in the build environment. If the credentials are stored in AWS Secrets Manager, ensure they are being correctly retrieved.

You can troubleshoot this by adding debug prints in your buildspec to ensure the `NEXUS_USERNAME` and `NEXUS_PASSWORD` environment variables are populated correctly:
```bash
echo "NEXUS_USERNAME is: ${NEXUS_USERNAME}"
```

### 2. Use Proper Authentication Mechanism for Pip
The error also indicates that you might need to use an alternative authentication method for pip. Instead of passing credentials directly in the URL (`PIP_INDEX_URL=https://${NEXUS_USERNAME}:${NEXUS_PASSWORD}...`), you can try using a `.netrc` file for authentication, which you are already configuring.

Make sure that the `.netrc` file has the correct permissions and that it’s properly referenced by pip. Also, verify if the Nexus server is accessible from the build environment.

### 3. Update Dockerfile for Pip Authentication
Ensure your Dockerfile contains the correct setup to authenticate pip with Nexus. You might need to explicitly configure pip to use the `.netrc` file by adding:
```bash
RUN python3.8 -m pip config set global.index-url ${PIP_INDEX_URL}
```

Additionally, in the Dockerfile, modify the `pip install` command:
```bash
RUN python3.8 -m pip install --trusted-host ${PIP_TRUSTED_HOST} --index-url ${PIP_INDEX_URL} --user \
    streamlit==1.28.2 \
    dash==2.14.1 \
    gunicorn==21.2.0 \
    pandas \
    boto3 \
    s3fs \
    numpy \
    fsspec \
    awscli==1.27.106
```

### 4. Use `--password-stdin` for Docker Login
You are also getting a warning about using `--password` for Docker login. To resolve this, switch to using `--password-stdin`:
```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region ${AWS_REGION} | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin ${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_DEVOPS}.dkr.ecr.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com
```

By addressing these issues, your build should be able to authenticate correctly and proceed with installing the necessary dependencies.
